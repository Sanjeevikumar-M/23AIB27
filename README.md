# Vehicle Maintenance Scheduler

A lightweight, optimized microservice built with FastAPI to solve vehicle maintenance allocation. When faced with a daily constraint on mechanic hours, this service uses dynamic programming (0/1 Knapsack) to schedule services in a way that maximizes overall operational impact.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 1. Setup the Environment

#### On Windows:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### On Linux/macOS:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the Server
```bash
python run.py
```
The server will start locally at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 3. Run Tests
To verify the math behind the scheduler, run:
```bash
pytest
```

## 💡 How the Scheduler Works Under the Hood
1. **Upstream Data Collection**: The service pulls depot budgets and vehicle workloads from the external evaluation APIs using an async client (`httpx`).
2. **0/1 Knapsack Solver**: For each depot, we compute the optimal set of tasks using a 2D dynamic programming grid. This guarantees the maximum operational impact score without exceeding the mechanic hours.
3. **Sequential Reservation**: Vehicles scheduled at one depot are removed from the shared list to prevent duplicate assignments across other depots.
